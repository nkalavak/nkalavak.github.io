Abstract: We describe the design and working of a robotic device that can be used for the rescue of children trapped in borewells. 
The design is inspired by taking into account the reasons for failure of previously existing methods. 
A key feature of the device is its ability to lift a child with the help of a safety cage, instead of a grasping mechanism. 
The device has the capacity to shrink the size to lower into the borewell, thereby not affecting the wall. 
The joint angles have a facility of rotating 360 degrees, enabling the device to find a gap in any direction, without hurting the child. 
The radial movement of the device also enables it to function for a borewell ranging from 25.4 centimeters to 45.72 centimeters in diameter. 
The suitability of the proposed system is demonstrated by several experiments to test reliability of the developed prototype.
